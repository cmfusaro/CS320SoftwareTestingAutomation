How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

I ensure that my code is functional and secure through several paths. The first would be ensuring I have sufficient code coverage with testing. The second would be to employ best practices and use the most up-to-date software I have available. The third would be to check for known exploits and vulnerabilities of any third-party packages I plan to use in my software. These three practices would provide an adequate framework to start and set me up for success.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

The best way to ensure that user needs are appropriately incorporated into a program is through thoughtful design meetings with stakeholders and users of the software. Having an accurate picture of what all involved have envisioned will provide the best place to ensure that all are served properly by the software you are working to create. For most companies looking to have software designed for them, this may be their first time, and they may not know the intricacies of all parts of the system they are looking for.  This is where experience comes in for crafting an accurate requirements list, and will serve the customer in a manner that will help them get the most return on investment.

How do I approach designing software?

I approach software design with the test-driven development methodology. It is going to be a requirement for all software developers to provide tests for their work at some point, so I would like to practice this as often as I am able to hone these skills. This allows for a constant source of truth while developing which will enable you to move forward with confidence that the software is providing a constant and correct result.
